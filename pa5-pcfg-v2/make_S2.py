    Build  S2.py for NLP class PA5
    
    Typical usage:
        python make_S2.py > S2.gr
        
    In the pa5-pcfg-v2 assignment, *.gr are grammar files that give production
    rules in a grammar and probabilities for those rules (see README.txt in this
    directory).
    
    S2.gr is the baseline grammar that generates any sentence over the lexicon
    Vocab.gr
    
    This script generates S2.gr as a trigram language model with back-off to 
    bigrams and +1 smoothed unigrams. This seems like a reasonable behavior
    for a grammar that only generates every allowed sentence.

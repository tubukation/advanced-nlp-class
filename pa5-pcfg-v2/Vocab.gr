# This is a hand-generated set of preterminal rules.
# It specifies a simple tag set which will be handled by the S2
# grammar and which can (though doesn't necessarily need to be)
# handled by the S1 grammar.
#
# The weights given here may be changed, but no new vocabulary
# items are to be added.

# Miscellaneous items that don't fit into any of our simple tags are
# given to _Misc.  You will want to develop your own tags for these!

# Singular and mass nouns.  Notice that only the
# ones that start with consonants get our Noun tag.
